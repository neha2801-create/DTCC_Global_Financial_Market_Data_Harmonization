# Global Financial Market Data Harmonization Project

## Problem Statement
Despite post-2008 financial crisis reforms in derivatives trading and reporting, financial regulators face significant challenges in obtaining a comprehensive view of market activity due to:
- Inconsistent data formats across different jurisdictions
- Varying reporting standards between exchanges
- Multiple currency denominations
- Lack of standardized data elements
- Difficulties in cross-border data sharing and analysis

## Objective
Develop a machine learning solution to:
1. Harmonize financial market data across different exchanges
2. Create standardized reporting formats
3. Enable real-time risk assessment across global markets
4. Facilitate regulatory oversight through unified data analysis

## Impotant terms:


1. RSI → Momentum and Reversal Points
2. MACD → Trend Changes and Strength
3. Volume → Confirmation of Price Moves
4. Volatility → Risk Levels
5. Bollinger Bands → Price Channels and Extremes
